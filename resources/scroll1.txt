Our world is infected. A plague, always present, but latent, has risen to the surface of the societies of our planet. The lives of entire countries, nations, especially future generations, are threatened by a sickness, as eagerly transmitted as a gift. This virus does not possess life of its own; it is merely the instructions for human beings to reach into their bodies, and slowly alter their makeup, until they are rendered slaves, subservient to the will of this lifeless entity. Once transforming the original host, the virus instructs the host to infect those around them, spreading the plague's footprint. This plague, though, does have a cure. It has been known for millennia. Resistance, even weak, subtle resistance, can work the virus out of the system, and reclaim the liberty of the host. To our deep misfortune, the virus is cloaked in seductive garb, and the majority of people happily forfeit their liberty, and embrace this creeping sickness. Alas, the innovations of our generation do not rid the contagion. Instead they incite the world to continue with their infectious way of life, self-injecting this charming curse at every opportunity. Alas, the truth is that everyone, every single soul on this planet, carries the disease to a certain extent. However, it is those who recognize that fact, that make the effort to alter their state, and change the world for the better, one mindset at a time. 
Great, enough analog buildup! - you might be thinking. You are right in a sense, but as you further contemplate this reality, you will begin to realize the strength of the analogy. .
