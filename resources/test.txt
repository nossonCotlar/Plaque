'''Our world is infected. A plague, always present, but latent, has risen to the surface of the societies of our planet. The lives of entire countries, nations, especially future generations, are threatened by a sickness, as eagerly transmitted as a gift. This virus does not possess life of its own; it is merely the instructions for human beings to reach into their bodies, and slowly alter their makeup, until they are rendered slaves, subservient to the will of this lifeless entity. Once transforming the original host, the virus instructs the host to infect those around them, spreading the plague’s footprint. This plague, though, does have a cure. It has been known for millennia. Resistance, even weak, subtle resistance, can work the virus out of the system, and reclaim the liberty of the host. To our deep misfortune, the virus is cloaked in seductive garb, and the majority of people happily forfeit their liberty, and embrace this creeping sickness. Alas, the innovations of our generation do not rid the contagion. Instead they incite the world to continue with their infectious way of life, self-injecting this charming curse at every opportunity. Alas, the truth is that everyone, every single soul on this planet, carries the disease to a certain extent. However, it is those who recognize that fact, that make the effort to alter their state, and change the world for the better, one mindset at a time. 
Great, enough analog buildup! - you might be thinking. You are right in a sense, but as you further contemplate this reality, you will begin to realize the strength of the analogy. 
The vexation that haunts the nations, the contagion responsible for the ailment of billions, takes more explanation than a one-word name, but we'll assign one anyway. Non-Constructive Concern. NonCon. The beautiful escort, schemefully advising its victims, arranging the downfall of our race. NonCon is the desire within every person for involvement in others’ matters. Involvement for the gain of the one who is involving themselves, and not of those whom the matters belong to. Granted, the host of the NonCon parasite always views their actions as help to the one they are concerned with, and poses as attempting to benefit the receiver of the NonCon’s attention. When in fact, the only reason, and the only outcome (as it relates to the host) of this concern, is the enjoyment and  fulfillment of the NonCon host. 
This is fundamentally different to genuine acts of concern and care, taking interest and action for the real benefit of the other person. Without this genuine concern, the human race would likely have not made it this far, and much of the beneficial constructs, both physical and social, would be lacking. This small but integral distinction differentiates NonCon, from TruCon. 
The dangerous proximity of these two attitudes may be of partial responsibility to how widespread the pandemic of NonCon has become. Surely an enemy, an evil inclination, would not introduce itself as such. It would don the appearance of a positive and accepted member of our mental makeup, proposing advice that smells like the warm words of TruCon, which we are rightfully taught to embrace. The vast majority of people succumb to the ways of NonCon, truly believing that they are performing according to the TruCon construct. This act of sly mental espionage is not performed uniquely by NonCon. In truth, every negative inclination possessed by humans must first stem from a favorable source, in order to influence its host towards its own goals. 

To our misfortune, though, exposure to these acts of trickery only desensitize a person’s perception towards similar attacks, rather than building an immunity response to them. The more the brain is accustomed to viewing non-credible influences as benign, the more the guard is let down towards bright colored influences, who may house dark instructions to unleash, once they are supplied with trust. The virus of NonCon, along with countless other social pathogens, has evolved over great time to display such welcome intentions, with each evolution targeting its current generation’s point of failure. This skillful act of camouflage poses the greatest weak point in our race’s immunity towards NonCon.
