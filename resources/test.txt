"I thought I'd find you here" said the Arsonist as he calmly walked towards the blaze. 
"What can I say? I like things hawt" Skippy replied, not turning his face away from the fire. 
It was a frigid spring night on Pocusset street; and on that snaking stretch of the road, it was easy enough for someone to fool himself into thinking that they'd momentarily slipped into another universe. It was a place that evoked warm memories, and it smelled strongly of the smoke of burnt time. 
"What are you doing here?" asked the Arsonist, as he sat down next to the fire, warming his chilly hand with the lively blaze. "You know that if you get caught again there'll be a $2000 fine, not to mention that you'll be detained. Besides, you didn't invite me."
"Well, you just know that I won't pass up an opportunity to look cool wearing a leather jacket" said Skippy, eliciting a cute laugh from the Arsonist. Damn, Skippy loved those laughs. "Besides, I thought that you said that you were going to Raiyaid with Cook and F1?"
"Well, we went there and we got back already" said the Arsonist. 
"If that took 15 minutes, F1 is still huffing and puffing down Hobart. Heck, Cook probably needed to jog."
"Well, you know," said the Arsonist, playing with the strings of his fuckboy sweater, "I did want to see you."
This is it thought Skippy. He's going to say something that will imply many sex. 
"Okay, Dud, listen" he lied. "I'm not gay. Like, I like you as a friend and all, but I don't do that shit."
The Arsonist recoiled in shock. "Bih I was going to ask if you want to have a beer that I got from the Pry Dry. Dude I'm not gay, what the f$&@ would you think that?"
"Oh. Well. F$&@. Um. Well. Forget I said that"
"I'm not that forgetful." 
"Oh, well then."
F$&@ thought Skippy. I'm so screwed. Everyone probably thought I was a lil' gay, but not like this. I'm so screwed. 
Skippy looked up to see the Arsonist looking at him with a concerned look on his face. "Dos, are you on drugs?" Asked the Arsonist. 
"No! Why would you think that?" asked Skippy. 
"Well two reasons. Firstly, because I'm trying to justify what you said. Secondly, because you just zoned out for 15 minutes. I called your name a bunch of times, and I was getting real concerned. I was considering calling an ambulance or something."
"Naw, don't overreact. I was just thinking."
Silence. 
"So you were serious?" Teased the Arsonist. 
Silence. 
Skippy considered what to say. He could try to fake his way out of it, but he knew that the Arsonist was much more cunning than he let on. 
On the other hand, he could try say the truth, and plea for mercy. But he knew that the Arsonist may see nothing wrong with telling F1. Actually, there was nothing wrong with telling F1, but he'd never hear the end of it. Ever. 
On the third, alien hand, there was one more hope that he had. It would make everything perfect. It was a big gamble, but the payoff was massive. 
Ok [enter], he thought, time to really do it he thought to himself. 
"You know what?" Skippy exclaimed, "Yes. I was serious. I'm legit gay. I like vapes, men, bai5, and those green balthouse farm things. And I've had a crush on you for a while. But you haven't been so straight either. I mean, if you change your gender, you and Cook would be a perfect couple!"
"Are you saying that I'm gay?" asked the Arsonist in shock?
"I'm saying that you're definitely not straight! You touched tongues with F1, and you werent screaming rape!" 
"That was-"
"That is bullshit. You enjoyed it a lil' bits."
The Arsonist sighed heavily. "Crez du, Dos; I'm a lil' bi. And TBH I've got a lil' crush on you too. I mean, you had your jacket tailored to be form fitting goddah! But I'm definitely not gonna have sex wif you just because we both have a crush on each other. Goddah Dos!"
"Um aktchualy, that's usually when people hook up."
"Goddah Dos, you sound like F1. It just doesn't go in there!"
"Well," said Skippy, thinking fast, " we can do this: if anyone finds out, I'll say that I raped you. That way you can stop being such a pussy and stop lying to yourself."
"Really?" asked the Arsonist, looking a lil' tearful. 
"Sure, why not. At least one of us will be able stay in school." 
"Do you have lube, or a condom?"
"Luckily for you, I was testing out how well lube burns, and I've still got half a bottle. It burns really well by the way. F1 said that it's because it's a hydrocarbon or something."
"But what about a condom?" 
"Dude, were virgins. We don't have STDs."
"But I can get pregnant!"
"Bih, you're a boy."
"Oh right."

The Arsonist had burnt many things before, including himself, but he'd never enjoyed a burning sensation as much as he was while he was being ignited by Skippy's lighter. They'd argued about who would be on bottom and who would be on top for a while. When Skippy heard that the Arsonist had never fingered himself, he insisted on taking his virginity. The Arsonist was too excited to argue too much. He figured that he'd save his penis for his wife; but after five minutes of taking it from Skippy, he figured that he may be saving it for his husband. 

Skippy was excited to finally have the Arsonist. He was so smooth, and his silky blond hair was orgasmic. Literally. 
He didn't know where it would go from here. He'd started out thinking that it would be a one time thing, but he was reconsidering. 

After much sex (of which the author has no idea how much) they fell asleep, half naked, in each other's arms. The moonlight on the mysterious universe that now belonged to both of them shared no secrets, and they slumbered, for the first time in a while, at peace with themselves. 

They woke up to the sound of Cook hurling. 
"Guys, wtf!!! It's 12:00, and no one knows where you are! I thought that you may be here, and then the Pry Dry confirmed it. Were you guys just having sex?" The last sound was asked in a quieter tone. 
In answer to his question, Skippy kissed the Arsonist for a couple of seconds. 
"Goddah you two, I thought this may happen. Luckily for you, I've got y'all a backup plan."
He pulled out two bags of crystal meth. 
"Boi, where'd you get that from?" Asked the couple together?
"Gniwish has a meth lab, of course. F1 helped him start it up, but he runs it on his own. The plan is that you pretend to have been under the influence, and because you got it from a shliach that's under the Sly Dry, he'll let you out with a 'warning'. The Pry Dry says it's a watertight plan."
"Well then," said Skippy, "pass it here."
"Well, it wasn't free. It'll cost $200, and the Pry Dry said that you both need to do chitasrambam for a month."
"Do we have a choice?"
"No, not really."
"F$&@. Fine then."
Skippy pulled out $300 and gave it to Cook. "Keep the change" he said. 
Cook happily walked away, muttering "rikbik" under his breath. 
"Consider this to be a gift for the first date" he said to the Arsonist. He planted a soft kiss on his forehead, and the Arsonist said nothing, because he'd already fallen asleep again. 
Skippy and the Arsonist made up to do as much as they could to make sure that Cook and F1 weren't alone for long enough for the story to be conveyed. That's why they were utterly confused when, as they turned onto Wightman, they heard F1s voice saying "so, how was the sex, guys?"
"How the f$&@ do you know about this?" asked Skippy. 
"Time travel. Biiih. I got Mihasted alone by... doing something fun in about two weeks. Once I knew, I couldn't not go back in time to tell myself!"
"F$&@" the new couple whispered simultaneously.
