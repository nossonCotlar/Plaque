DAILY CHUMASH SUMMARY:
Moses then taught the Jewish people that after they settle the Land of Israel and begin working the land, G-d has obligated them to bring a tenth of their oil, wine, and grain to the Temple-city and consume it there. This ensured that the people would regularly visit Jerusalem (which was chosen to be the Temple-city) in order to renew their spiritual inspiration.

DAILY MESSAGE - Charity and Wealth

[Moses told the Jewish people,] You must tithe all the produce of the seed that the field yields year by year. Deuteronomy 14:22
This verse includes the instruction to donate a portion of our income to charity. The Talmudic sages pointed out that the similarity of the Hebrew words for tithe (taaseir) and become rich (titasheir) alludes to the fact that G-d rewards those who give charity with abundant wealth.

Furthermore, when we resolve to give charity beyond our means, G-d grants us the wealth that is required in order for us to give the charity we have resolved to donate.
