DAILY CHUMASH SUMMARY:
Moses then reassured the Jewish people that despite the threats he had just pronounced, they should be confident in their ability to remain true to G-ds covenant and enjoy His protection.

DAILY MESSAGE: The Key to Success

The Hebrew word for succeed (taskilu) also means comprehend. Thus, this verse implies that by fulfilling G-ds commandments, we will comprehend all that we should do.

There are many aspects of life in which we struggle to determine how to act in the most spiritually positive manner. By living in accordance with the Torahs instructions, we become sensitive to G-ds will. This, in turn, aids us in comprehending how to act in accordance with G-ds will in the context of those areas of life not directly governed by specific commandments.
