DAILY CHUMASH SUMMARY: Moses then told the Jewish people that when they are confronted with a challenge to their faith (such as the prosperity of the wicked or of false prophets), they must remember that G-d is testing their loyalty and commitment to Him.

DAILY MESSAGE = Tests of Faith

[Moses told the Jewish people,] G-d is testing you to determine whether you really love G-d with all your heart and all your soul. Deuteronomy 13:4
We are tested when we witness a lack of the Divine favor that we assume is entitled to those who follow G-ds will. Voices from both within and without mock the sufferers naove belief. When G-ds presence is hidden in these situations, it simply means that He wishes to grace us with a closer, more intense relationship with Him. In order to preserve our faith in G-d in the face of situations that test this faith, we have to draw upon deeper levels of commitment than we normally do.

When we pass the test, the test disappears  its purpose having been served  and our formerly deep, hidden connection with G-d becomes our new normative consciousness.
