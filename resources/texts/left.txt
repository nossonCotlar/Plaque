Moses then proceeded to describe the revelation of G-d at the Giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai.

Overcoming the Limits of Creation

[Moses told the Jewish people that at Mount Sinai,] You were shown in order to know that G d is the only deity. There is nothing other than Him. Deuteronomy 4:35
By revealing His essence, which is beyond Creation, G-d enabled us to transcend the limits of nature, as well. In order to overcome lifes challenges and tests, we need only remind ourselves that there is nothing other than Him, i.e., that nothing can constitute a real obstacle to fulfilling G-ds intentions, since everything, in the final analysis, is part of G-ds essence. Evoking this awareness elevates our Divine consciousness to the level of truly perceiving G-ds essence everywhere. This, in turn, serves to hasten the Messianic Redemption, when the glory of G-d will be revealed and all flesh will see it together.
