Av 11, 5779 - August 12, 2019
 In material matters one should always look at he whose situation is lower than one's own, and thank the good G-d for His kindness to him.
In spiritual matters one should always look at he who is higher than oneself, and plead with G-d to grant him the intelligence to learn from the other, and the ability and strength to rise higher. 
-- Hayom Yom, Cheshvan 24
