Sivan 15, 5779 - June 18, 2019
 "See, I give you today a blessing and a curse" (Deuteronomy 11:26). Moses is giving the Children of Israel the power of sight: to perceive that the true nature of evil is nothing more than a transmutation and distortion of the Divine good. When evil is thus seen, it can be transformed into the good that it essentially is. 
-- The Lubavitcher Rebbe
