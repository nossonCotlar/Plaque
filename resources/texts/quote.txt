Av 3, 5779 - August 4, 2019
 Despite all the wisdom granted to [King] Solomon... he was mystified by the Four Kinds. As it is written (Proverbs 30:18): "Three things are wondrous to me..." - these are the Passover offering, matzah and maror [eaten at the Passover seder]; "...and four I do not know" - these are the Four Kinds [taken on Sukkot]. 
-- Midrash Rabbah, Vayikra 30:14
