Av 18, 5779 - August 19, 2019
 Groaning by itself won't do a bit of good. A groan is only a key to open the heart and eyes, so as not to sit there with folded arms, but to plan orderly work and activity, each person wherever he can be effective, to campaign for bolstering Torah, spreading Torah and the observance of mitzvot. One person might do this through his writing, another with his oratory, another with his money... 
-- Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak of Lubavitch (quoted in Hayom Yom, Tevet 23)
