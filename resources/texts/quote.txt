Sivan 21, 5779 - June 24, 2019
 And you shall count for yourselves from the morrow of the Shabbat, from the day on which you bring the Omer offering, seven complete weeks they shall be; until the morrow of the seventh week, you shall count fifty days . . . and you shall proclaim that very day a holy festival. 
-- Leviticus 23:15
