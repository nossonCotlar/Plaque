Av 7, 5779 - August 8, 2019
 Among the religions of the world there are various customs, and they do not all gather in the same house [of worship]. We, however, have but one G-d, one Torah, one law, one Kohen Gadol and one Sanctuary; yet you, two hundred and fifty men, all desire the High Priesthood! I, too, desire it! 
-- Moses to Korach and his followers (Midrash Tanchuma on Numbers 16:10)
