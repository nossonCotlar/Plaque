Daily Quote: Sivan 2, 5779 - June 5, 2019
 From the time that G-d said to our father Abraham, "Go from your land..." and "Abraham went on, journeying southward", began the process of "birurim" -- of extracting the sparks of holiness that are scattered throughout the universe and buried within the material existence... By the decree of Divine providence, a person wanders about in his travels to those places where the sparks that are to be extracted by him await their redemption... 
-- Rabbi Sholom DovBer of Lubavitch (1860-1920)
